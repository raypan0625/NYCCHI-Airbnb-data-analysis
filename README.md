# NYCCHI-Airbnb-data-analysis
People love traveling to metropolis, especially NYC and Chicago. Staying at Airbnb is popular since it is
cheaper and safer while offering various travel experiences. We would like to perform a research on this due
to the fact that sharing economy is a trend in the modern world and analysis of dataset like this would help
us build background information for future researches. Here is some dataset from Airbnb open data about
the reservation in NYC in 2019 and Chicago from 2017-2019. The two dataset each contains 15 columns.
The Chicago dataset contains 6398 records and the NYCcontains 48896 records. Some important variables
include room type, price, coordinates, and availability, etc.
